<h3>DCS Undergraduate Project Portal</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    The DCS Undergraduate Project Portal is a Student-Research Project matching
    program developed by students from the Department of Computer Science at the University
    of Toronto.
</p>

<p>
    DCSUPP allows students to view and apply to projects. It also allows researchers and
    professors to post projects. DCSUPP also includes project applications and project to
    student matching. Our site reuses application information as much as possible to user
    experience.
