                        p The DCS Undergraduate Project Portal is designed to match students with research projects based on their prerequisites. 

                        dt How it Works:
                        dd
                            | Registered Faculty and Researchers would add their research projects onto the DCSUPP platform with their project information and student prerequisites. Students can also input their prerequisites into the DCSUPP system and apply for potential projects.

                        dt Filtering and Matching:
                        dd
                            | The DCSUPP allows faculty to filter for potential students and students to filter for potential projects. The development team is currently working on creating a matching algorithm between students and projects to further simplify the process.
