                            | DCSUPP is developed by students at the University of Toronto.

                        dt SubCategories
                        dd Requirement SubCategories are Student Attributes or Project Information that professors or researchers can add to their projects to automate and standardize the matching process.

                        dt Example
                        dd
                            b CSC 4th Year Grades (Category)
                            ol 
                                li CSC 494 Grade (SubCategory + Student Attribute)
                                li CSC 411 Grade (SubCategory + Student Attribute)
                                li CSC 412 Grade (SubCategory + Student Attribute)
                            b Project Information (Category)
                            ol 
                                li Project Link (SubCategory)
                                li Project Deadline (SubCategory)
                            p In this case, the CSC 4th Year Grades are Student Attributes, but the Project Informations are not student attributes for matching and is only used to add information to the project.
