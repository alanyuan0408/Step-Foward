# State: Index
#
# This state has no associated HTML view, it is just the
# landing state when the application is first
# initialized or when the
# application is refreshed/URL is being
# manually entered/user has hit the back button.
# If the application is being
# initialized for the first time,
# then Index state will redirect the app
# to the Intro page. If the application is being
# refreshed//URL is being
# manually entered/user has hit the back button,
# the server will pass back the
# URL to go to reload it
# using the code URL parsing function down below.

        #   If application is being initialized: go to intro page
        #   If application is being refreshed//URL is being
        #   manually entered/user has hit the back button: the
        #   server will pass back to URL (stored in stateParams.goto)
        #   to go to in a format such as the following:
        #   "http://localhost:3000/?goto=current_project%2Fproject_info%2F61"
        #   => equivalent to state: "current_project.project_info({id: 61})"
        #   The URL is then parsed (so that UI router can understand it)
        #   and loaded into the view.
        #
        #   The state name in DCSUPP app take the following forms:
        #   1) [ parent state ].[ child state](optional param id)
        #   2) [ state ](optional param id)
        #
        #   So the parse function will parse the URL into both of these
        #   forms and attempt to go into each of these states using
        #   a try/catch block.
