Here are the list of unfinished features and the current progress made on each of the features prior to the point.

My progress for DCSUPP started on Jan 2015 and Ended on Nov 6 2015. End of V1.0

Features for V2.0:
**** Input Student Information is already done (And it took the bulk of the time), however, it is not used for the filter or project matching at the moment. We really should take advantage of this feature of the next Iteration as soon as possible ****

1) Filter for Students and Projects (30% done):
=> I added the tabs inside the Student + Project page where it is intended to be added. The requirement categories + validations are completed and adding the filters should be adding an array of JSON restricts and resolving a list of nested SQL queries in the backend and sending it back to the frontend

2) Reference Requests (80% done):
=> The professor request system is already done and currently working + students can search for professors. However:
#1 the navigation tab should include a notification features to indicate there is a new request from a student to improve navigation
#2 the professor reference request should also include PDF upload + new features (We will need to do some surveys with professors to better determine this)

3) CKeditor:
=> Right now, the input text for projects is all plain text, we would like to add a WYSIWYG editor seen on alot of sites. However, adding these features could introduce Javascript/ CSS injection + the if CSS/ JS compiling is not done on the backend, the loading for various files could be very slow.

4) CSS/ Frontpage Layout (Not Priorty):
=> Currently, I'm not too impressed about the navbar, the frontpage layout as well as the poster for DCSUPP. We may need to improve it for V 2.0

5) Mobile/ Phone Resizing (Not Priorty):
=> Currently, the columns scale for the phone and tablet appropiately, however the UI is not Optimial. We may need to redesign the CSS to be more optimial for different devices.

6) Browse Professor (70% done):
=> Currently, there is an incomplete $stateparams page in the folder ListProfessor. However, the page lacks any meaningful propose. Maybe we could have a professor introduction page + linking to their research projects? (We may mneed to do some surveys to determine this)

7) Add Users/ Professors/ Administratrs:
=> Currently, the third floor administrators need to add professors, administrators etc maunually using SQL insert statements. We may need to add a GUI interface for a master account to add these accounts.

8) Fix Site loading time:
=> Currently, the loading time for the site on the first iteration is 4-5 seconds, we may to find a way to cut it down a bit
