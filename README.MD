# DCS Undergraduate Project Portal

This is the source code for the DCS Undergraduate Project Portal (_DCSUPP_). 
DCSUPP is a project-student matching platform developed by students in the 
Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

### 1. Project History

The DCS Undergraduate Project Portal started as a course project supervised 
by Professor François Pitt and developed by Alan Yuan. The portal is intended 
to match research projects with undergraduate students. Before DCSUPP, the 
Department of Computer Science used a combination of Job Discussion 
Board posts, NSERC applications with weighted preferences and mass professor-to-student email communications for for matching students with research projects.

The lack of an organized, central communications system resulted in unfilled numerous research 
opportunities. In addition, many students 
took research projects outside of their interests purely for the research 
credit.

### 2. Project Features

DCSUPP allows professors and researchers to post research projects onto the 
projects board. The projects are then matched with students who are signed up 
with the system.

* Introduces innovative student matching system based on student preferences 
  and pre-requisites.
* Saves student preferences to avoid input repetition.
* Highly customizable project and student attribute framework.
* Designed to scale for campus wide search.
* Adds easy student-to-project application process, supports PDF and recycles 
  attributes.
* Graphical analysis of student and project pre-requisites.

We have worked to ensure the DCSUPP is very simple to use and reduces 
unnecessary attribute entries.

### 4. Framework Overview

The DCSUPP project is built on Ruby on Rails Framework. We have used Slim, 
Coffeescript, SASS, Twitter Bootstrap, Angular.js, and Charts.js for frontend 
development. We would like to thank all open-source developers for creating 
such wonderful frameworks and libraries.

### 5. Credits

The project is supervised by Professor François Pitt.
